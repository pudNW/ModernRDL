# ModernRDL

> A modern, open-source, web-based report builder for `.rdlc` files. Making report design intuitive and enjoyable again.

## The Problem
Editing `.rdlc` files with the existing Report Builder is often a cumbersome and outdated experience. The UI is unintuitive, the WYSIWYG editor is unreliable, and it lacks modern features. This project aims to solve that.

## Our Vision
To create a fast, intuitive, and truly WYSIWYG report builder that runs in the browser. We want to build a tool that developers and report designers **love** to use.

## Core Features (Roadmap)
- [ ] Load and render existing `.rdlc` files.
- [ ] Visual drag-and-drop interface.
- [ ] True WYSIWYG live preview.
- [ ] Modern property editor panel.
- [ ] Simplified data binding (starting with JSON).
- [ ] Export back to a valid `.rdlc` format.
